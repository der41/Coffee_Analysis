Subject: Daily Coffee Transactions

Intended Audience
The manager of the Coffee shop: Sofia, 35 
Manages a busy neighborhood café in a mid-sized city. 
She has 10 employees, tracks sales daily, and juggles inventory, staffing, and promotions.
She’s business-savvy but not a data expert—she uses Excel or POS reports to make decisions and wants clearer insights without spending hours crunching numbers.

About Daily Coffee Transactions
This dataset records individual coffee-shop transactions between March 2024 and March 2025, capturing which drink was purchased, how much was spent, and how it was paid. It offers time-based, which enables analysis of sales patterns by type and time. 

1. How do coffee sales differ across the days of the week and time of the day?

2. What coffee categories drive most sales and what payment methods do customers like to utilize?
